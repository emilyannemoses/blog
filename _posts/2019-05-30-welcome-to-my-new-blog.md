This is my first blog post using this framework, and y'all are free to grab this and use it to build out your own blog as well.

There are a few rules to go by as you build out your blog!

Once you've cloned [this repository]:

0. Use the [Jekyll Installation Docs][installation] and [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] to get up and running with Jekyll on your machine.

1. You’ll begin by adding new posts in the `_posts` directory. 

1. Every new post must follow the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and include the necessary front matter (the content listed in the top of the post).

1. Use the front matter of the [second blog post][second-post] as a template until you remember the formula.

1. In order to view live changes, run `jekyll s`, which launches a web server.


If you need to embed code, Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Emily')
#=> prints 'Hi, Emily!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Happy blogging!
