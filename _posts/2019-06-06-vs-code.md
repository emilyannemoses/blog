title:  "Introduction to VS Code"
---

Visual Studio Code is a free and popular text editor for writting software programs in any programming language. It was created by Microsoft. There is a lot to this program, so I'll try to keep this post to what you must know to begin.

First, download Visual Studio Code: [Click on your operating system][download-vscode]

Open VS Code.  On the far left there's a menu list of icons. The first one looks like a piece of paper, clicking on this will hide and show the files in the Explorer column. In order to look for a specific file or directroy, go to `File -> Open` and select a specific folder or file. This folder or file will now populate the Explorer column.

The next icon down is a magnifying glass. Click on if it you'd like to search through the current directory. Use this as a literal text search - you can search for a single word, or a few words in a consecutive sentence.

We'll get to the rest of the icons later.

To create a new file, either click on the `file` icon within the Explorer column, or go to `File -> New File`.

Whenever you make a new file, make sure to put the specific extension of the language you'll be using. For example:

Markdown: `readme.md`<br>
Python: `pytest.py`<br>
JavaScript: `app.js`<br>
Ruby: `test.rb`<br>

You can only write and excute one language per file.

Happy coding!
